### *An experiment with words and clouds*

Clouds are ephemeral and untouchable, long perceived as carriers of human emotions and metaphors of impermanence. However, in the digital age, "the cloud" has been redefined as a rigid repository of data and algorithmic control.  Designed for efficiency, cloud computing systems suppress ambiguity, randomness, and serendipity, reducing uncertainty to error.They also ignored the nonlinearity, openness, and potential anti-control of the cloud.

This project seeks to dissolve these rigid structures, returning the cloud to a state of flux. A GPT model (a metaphor of digital cloud) is told to disguise itself as a cloud in the sky, interacts with humans, and randomly responds three-word phrases that begin with the input word (sometimes the model might make some mistakes), forming a kind of text precipitation that floats between meaning and ambiguity. These texts descend like rain -- at first discernible, then gradually becoming unclear, and the semantics fade. 

I invite you to join this improvisational performance. 

### *How to interact?*

Click the blue box, enter a single word (in English), and send it to the cloud.

If the words stack on top of each other but you want to see them clearly (or unclearly), try moving your mouse over the area to reveal them.

Move the Temperature slider to adjust the randomness of the response.

To save all the words, click Save to download them.
